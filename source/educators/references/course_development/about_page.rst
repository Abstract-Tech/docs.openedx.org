.. _Course Description:

********************************
Course Description
********************************

Descriptive course information includes information such as the course short
and long descriptions, as well as information about what learners will learn,
the subject, and the difficulty level.

.. _Course Short Description Guidelines:

========================================
Course Short Description Guidelines
========================================

An effective short description follows these guidelines.

* Contains 25–50 words.
* Functions as a tagline.
* Conveys compelling reasons to take the course.
* Follows search engine optimization (SEO) guidelines.
* Targets a global audience.


--------------------------------
Example Short Description
--------------------------------

**Course Name:** The Science of Happiness 

**Course Description:** The first MOOC to teach positive psychology. Learn science-based principles and
practices for a happy, meaningful life.

.. _Course Long Description Guidelines:

========================================
Course Long Description Guidelines
========================================

Given the diversity of online learners, be sure to review your course
description to ensure that it clearly communicates the target audience, level,
and prerequisites for your course. Use concrete, unambiguous phrasing, such as
a prerequisite of "understand eigenvalue decomposition" rather than
"intermediate linear algebra".

An effective long description follows these guidelines.

* Contains 150–300 words.
* Is easy to skim.
* Uses bullet points instead of dense text paragraphs.
* Follows SEO guidelines.
* Targets a global audience.


--------------------------------
Example Long Descriptions
--------------------------------

The following long description is a content-based example.

  Want to learn computer programming, but unsure where to begin? This is the
  course for you! Scratch is the computer programming language that makes it
  easy and fun to create interactive stories, games and animations and share
  them online.

  This course is an introduction to computer science using the programming
  language Scratch, developed by MIT. Starting with the basics of using
  Scratch, the course will stretch your mind and challenge you. You will learn
  how to create amazing games, animated images and songs in just minutes with a
  simple “drag and drop” interface.

  No previous programming knowledge needed. Join us as you start your computer
  science journey.

The following long description is a skills-based example.

  Taught by instructors with decades of experience on Wall Street, this M&A
  course will equip analysts and associates with the skills they need to rise
  to employment in the M&A field. Additionally, directors and managers who have
  transitioned, or hope to transition, to M&A from other areas such as equities
  or fixed income can use this course to eliminate skill gaps.

.. _Learning Outcome Guidelines:

========================================
Learning Outcome Guidelines
========================================

It is good practice to include a list of learning outcomes describing the skills and knowledge
learners will acquire in the course in an itemized list. It is recommended that
you format each item as a short bullet item.


--------------------------------
Example Learning Outcomes
--------------------------------

* Write basic R scripts to manipulate and visualize data.
* Apply linear and logistic regression techniques to analyze real-world datasets and interpret the results.
* Apply text analytics techniques to extract insights from a given dataset and present their findings.
* Formulate and solve linear and integer optimization problems


.. _Course and Program Images and Videos:

************************************************
Images and Videos for a Course or Program

.. _Set Course Prerequisites:

========================================
Skill and Knowledge Prerequisites
========================================

You might want to make sure your learners have a specific set of skills
and knowledge before they take your course. This information appears on the
course About page.


Optionally, you can also require that learners complete a specific course
before they enroll in your course, or that learners complete an entrance exam
before they access course content. This information also appears on the About
page, but you specify these prerequisites on the **Schedule & Details** page
in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Specify Prerequisite Courses <Specify Prerequisite Courses>` and
:ref:`Require an Entrance Exam <Require an Entrance Exam>`.

You add skill and knowledge prerequisites in Studio. For more information,
see :ref:`Creating a Course About Page <Creating a Course About Page>`.

------------------------------------------
Example Skill and Knowledge Prerequisites
------------------------------------------

* Secondary school (high school) algebra; basic mathematics concepts
* Graduate-level understanding of Keynesian economics
* Basic algebra
* Familiarity with eigenvalue decomposition



.. _Prerequisite Courses:

========================================
Prerequisite Courses
========================================

When you require your learners pass a particular course before they
enroll in your course, learners see information about course prerequisites on
the course **About** page.

  :alt: A course About page with prerequisite course information circled.

If learners have not completed the prerequisite course, they can enroll in
your course and then see your course on their learner dashboards. However,
unlike with other courses, the dashboard does not provide a link to the
course content. The dashboard includes a link to the **About** page for the
prerequisite course. Learners can enroll in the prerequisite course from the
**About** page.

Prerequisite Courses <Specify Prerequisite Courses>`.

.. _Entrance Exam Prerequisite:

========================================
Entrance Exam
========================================

You can require your learners to pass an entrance exam before they access
your course materials. If you include an entrance exam, learners who enroll
in your course can access only the **Entrance Exam** page until they pass the
exam. After learners pass the exam, they can access all released materials in
your course.

You enter this information in Studio. For more information, see :ref:`Require
an Entrance Exam <Require an Entrance Exam>`.

---------------------------------
Best Practices for Entrance Exams
---------------------------------

We strongly recommend you follow several guidelines to help you and your
learners have a positive experience with entrance exams.

* Make sure your beta testers include the entrance exam when they test
  your other course content.

* Make sure you mention the entrance exam in the course description on
  your course **About** page. Otherwise, learners will not know about the
  entrance exam before they enroll in your course and try to access course
  content.

* Add an announcement to the **Course Updates & News** page that contains
  information and instructions for learners who need to take the exam. When
  learners first try to access content in a course that has an entrance exam,
  they see the **Course Updates & News** page. We suggest you include
  the following information.

  * To begin the course entrance exam, learners select **Entrance Exam**.

  * After learners complete the entrance exam, they must select **Entrance
    Exam** again or refresh the page in their browsers. After the page
    refreshes, learners can access all currently available course content.

.. _Syllabus Guidelines:

========================================
Syllabus Guidelines
========================================

A syllabus is a review of content covered in your course, organized by week or
module. To create an effective syllabus, keep the following guidelines in mind.

* Focus on topics and content.
* Do not include detailed information about course logistics, such as grading,
  communication policies, and reading lists.
* Format items as either paragraphs or a bulleted list.


You can add the syllabus to your course About page. For more information, see
:ref:`Creating a Course About Page <Creating a Course About Page>`.

You can also add a syllabus to your course in Studio by creating a custom page
or a handout. For more information, see :ref:`Add Page <Adding Pages to a Course>` and :ref:`Add Course
Handouts <Add Course Handouts>`.

programs as well as conditional repetition.

.. _FAQ Guidelines:

========================================
FAQ Guidelines
========================================

To help prospective learners, you can add any frequently asked questions (FAQ)
and the answers to those questions to your About page.


You can add the FAQ to your course About page. For more information, see
:ref:`Creating a Course About Page <Creating a Course About Page>`.

--------------------------------
Example FAQ

**Q: Is the textbook required?**

A: No, the textbook is not required. However, you will find that it more
completely explains some of the concepts that we cover quickly in the course,
and will add depth to your understanding.

**Q: How much is the final exam worth?**

A: The final exam is worth 30% of the total grade. You can find more
information about the value of each assignment on your **Progress** page.

.. _Learner Testimonial Guidelines:

========================================
Learner Testimonial Guidelines
========================================

A learner testimonial is a quote from a learner in the course, demonstrating
the value of taking the course.
