Create a New Course in Studio

This topic describes how to use Studio to create and set up a course.

To create and run a course, you can either create an entirely new course in
Studio, or you can re-run an existing course. For more information about re-
running a course, see :ref:`Re-Run a Course <Re Run a Course>`.

You can also :ref:`export<Export a Course>` and :ref:`import<Import a Course>`
courses as XML files. You can do this when you need to back up a course or edit
the course in XML.

.. Note::
 

  The Organization, Course Number, and Course run values you enter when creating a course are part of the learner-visible course URL and cannot be changed. The base URL for the new course is in the format:

  ``https://your-domain/courses/course-v1:ORGANIZATION+COURSE_NUMBER+COURSE_RUN/``

  So take care when entering values for the new course.

#. Open Studio at the URL provided by your administrator.

#. Click :guilabel:`New Course`. The Create a New Course screen opens.

#. Enter information for the new course:

   * **Course Name**: The public display name of the course. You can override the name later in the Advanced Settings.

   * **Organization**: Your school or organization. This value becomes part of the course URL and cannot be changed. You can override how the organization is displayed to learners in Advanced Settings.

   * **Course Number**: The unique number that identifies your course. Note: This value becomes part of the course URL and cannot be changed. No spaces or special characters are allowed.

   * **Course Run**: The term or unique run of the course. This value part of your course URL, so no spaces or special characters are allowed and it cannot be changed.

#. Click :guilabel:`Create`.

.. END CREATE A NEW COURSE
