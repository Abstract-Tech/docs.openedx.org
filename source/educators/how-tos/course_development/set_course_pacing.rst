You can set a schedule for your course, including when content is released and due dates for assignments. You can allow learners to work at their own pace, as long as they complete the course within the course run time period.

************************
Instructor-Paced Courses
************************

Courses that follow a schedule that you set are known as instructor-paced courses. Select :guilabel:`Instructor-Paced` in the Course Schedule and Details screen.

******************
Self-Paced Courses
******************

Courses that allow learners to work at their own pace, as long as they are finished by the time the course ends, are known as self-paced courses. These courses offer learners flexibility to modify the assignment dates as needed. Select :guilabel:`Self-Paced` in the Course Schedule and Details screen.

Set Custom Pacing in Personalized Learning Schedules
********************************************************

For more information about Personalized Learning Schedules, see :ref:`Personalized Learning Schedule`.

Once you have created a graded assignment in your self-paced course, the assignment is eligible to be included in
a learner’s Personalized Learning Schedule (PLS), and it will automatically inherit default pacing.
Follow these steps to override the course’s default pacing, and enable custom pacing:

1. Click on the subsection’s configuration setting

2. Type the number of weeks you would like the assignment to be due in starting from the learner’s enrollment date.
   (Note: Leaving this field empty will cause the assignment to inherit default pacing)
