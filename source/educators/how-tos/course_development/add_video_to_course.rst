To add a video, follow these steps.

#. From Studio, in the unit where you want to place the video, under **Add New Component** select :guilabel:`Video`.

   A video with default settings is added to the unit.

#. In the video block, click Edit.

#. In the **Component Display Name** field, enter the name that you want learners to see for this video.

This name appears as a heading above the video in the LMS, and it identifies the video for you in reports and analytics. If you do not enter a display name, the platform specifies “video” for you.

#. Paste the video URL in the default Video URL field, and then enter the location of your video. This is the URL that was created when you uploaded the video to the hosting site.

   .. note::
      Youtube videos can be added by pasting the Youtube URL into the Video URL field.

   .. note::
      If you have created multiple versions that use different encodings or hosting
      services, add the URL for each video by selecting **Add a vido URL** below the
      **Fallback Videos** field and enter the URL in the **Video URL** field. The first
      listed video that is compatible with the learner's device plays.

      For the best experience for mobile users, make sure that the URL for the 360p
      version of the video is the first URL in the list.

#. Optionally, you can set more options for the video. For a description of each option,
   see :ref:`Video Settings`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save` to save the video in the unit.
