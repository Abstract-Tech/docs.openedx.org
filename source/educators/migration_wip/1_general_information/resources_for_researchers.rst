Resources for Researchers
**************************

At each partner institution, the data czar is the primary point of contact
for information about edX data. To set up a data czar for your institution,
contact your edX partner manager.

Data for the courses on edx.org and edX Edge is available to the data czars
at our partner institutions, and then used by database experts, statisticians,
educational investigators, and others for educational research.

Resources are also available for members of the Open edX community who are
collecting data about courses running on their sites and conducting research
projects.

==============
Documentation
==============

The `edX Research Guide`_ is available on the docs.edx.org web page. Although
it is written primarily for data czars and researchers at partner institutions,
this guide can also be a useful reference for members of the Open edX
community.

The *edX Research Guide* opens in your web browser, with a **Search docs**
field and links to sections and topics on the left side of each page. To open
or save a PDF version, select **v: latest** at the lower right of the page, and
then select **PDF**.

.. note:: If you use the Safari browser, be aware that it does not support the
 search feature for the HTML versions of the edX guides. This is a known
 limitation.

==============================
Discussion Forums and Email
==============================

Researchers, edX data czars, and members of the global edX data and analytics
community can post and discuss questions in our public research forum: the
`openedx-analytics`_ Google group.

The edX partner portal also offers community `forums`_, including a Research
and Analytics topic, for discussions among edX partners.

.. important:: Please do not post sensitive data to public forums.

Data czars who have questions that involve sensitive data, or that are
institution specific, can send them by email to data.support@edx.org
with a copy to your edX partner manager.

Wikis
======

The edX Analytics team maintains the `Open edX Analytics`_ wiki, which includes
links to periodic release notes and other resources for researchers.

The `edx-tools`_ wiki lists publicly shared tools for working with the edX
platform, including scripts for data analysis and reporting.
